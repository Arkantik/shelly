description: Set up a new project's foundation on day one. Use immediately after bootstrapping the shell into an empty or near-empty repo, before writing any feature code.

# Start project

Fills the shell's placeholders by interviewing the user, then verifies what it wrote. Runs once.
The goal is a CLAUDE.md an agent can act on in a cold session, not a complete project plan.

Ask in batches, not one question at a time. Propose a default for every question so the user can
accept rather than compose an answer.

## 1. What this is

- One paragraph: what the project does and who uses it.
- Own product or client work? Client work changes the deploy target, the commit conventions, and who verifies.
- Write it into the top of CLAUDE.md.

## 2. Stack and commands

- Language, runtime, package manager, repo shape.
- Then fill the commands table, and run every command you wrote. A command that does not run as written is worse than a missing one, because the agent will trust it. If the project is empty, mark them `<not yet>` and say they must be filled before the first feature.

## 3. Deploy target

- Pick from `.claude/skills/ship/targets/`. Default `coolify` for own projects, `handoff` for client infrastructure.
- `handoff`: walk its pre-engagement questions now. Who deploys, on what schedule, where env vars live, who can add one, what the rollback path is. These have the longest lead time and get discovered last.
- Record the answer in the Deploy target line in CLAUDE.md, and delete the target files the project does not use.

## 4. Localization, if any

- Will this ship in more than one language? If yes, decide now, because retrofitting is expensive.
- Key structure, locale routing, where date, number, and currency formatting happens, and whether content is translated or duplicated.
- Record as an ADR. This is a decision people re-litigate later.

## 5. The first three non-negotiables

- Three rules maximum. The ones worth interrupting work over.
- Each needs an evidence path so `/audit-foundation` can check it mechanically.
- No evidence path yet because the code does not exist? Write the rule with the path it will live at, and verify at the first audit.

## 6. Domain vocabulary

- Seed `docs/CONTEXT.md` with the terms already in use in the conversation. Three to five is plenty.
- For each, what it is and what it is not. The second line does more work than the first.

## 7. UI, if the project has one

- Run `/design-system` before any component exists. Tokens retrofitted onto a built UI is the most tedious refactor in frontend work.

## 8. Verify and close

- Run `scripts/check-scaffold.sh` and confirm no placeholder markers remain in committed files.
- Set `last_audit` in `docs/.foundation-state` to today.
- Delete skills the project will not use. `provisioning-safety` unless it creates infrastructure for users. `queues-and-rate-limits` unless there is a queue or a rate-limited API. `db-migration` unless there is a database. Record each deletion in `.claude/.shell-ignore`, one path per line, so a later sync does not bring it back.
- Commit as `chore: project foundation`.
- Report what is still unfilled. Do not leave a placeholder without naming it.

## Hard rules

- Never invent a stack detail the user did not confirm.
- Never write a command into the commands table without running it.
